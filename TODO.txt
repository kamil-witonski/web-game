TODO list


- fix the body angle when moving left
	* this should be achieved by changing the angle from radians to degress and taking away an offset

- fix the enemy not showing up on new map load
	* no clue whats up with this

- add a end game screen
	* use the values from the server to display a table of results
		* things like: kills, deaths, bullets fired etc...

- add a pre game menu
	- jump into a game & look at own stats
