TODO list
______________________

- fix bullet spawn to reflect the gun position

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- (FIXED) fix the body angle when moving left
	* this should be achieved by changing the angle from radians to degress and taking away an offset
	FIXED::: fixed by some mad dodgy coding, i dont understand how or why it works but it does, so im no touching it haha

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- fix the enemy not showing up on new map load
	* no clue whats up with this

	*	Blind Suggestions-
			*Redraw/Reload all sprites.
			*Send new map layer to back.
								*		-D

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- add a end game screen
	* use the values from the server to display a table of results
		* things like: kills, deaths, bullets fired etc...

		*We could use this idea as a work around if the above doesnt ever get fixed.	-D

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- add a pre game menu
	- jump into a game & look at own stats
